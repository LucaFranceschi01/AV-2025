    "# Context:  Visual Analytics for Customer segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In any sector or Industry, knowing and understanding the customer behavior is key. As Data Scientist we should be ready to answer questions as: “Can you identify which of our current customers should we target for our new product?” or \"How are our customers that buy product A, B or D?\". In other words, segmentating the customer base is so important in order to any organization can tailor and build targeted strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the Lecture class, a customer segmentation could be considered as a **unsupervised learning** case where there is not a **unique** solution because it depends on the design principles as **similarity**, **number of clusters**,.... It’s a challenging use case as a data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this lab, our aim is to create a segmentation based on a clustering process to group customers that are \"similar\" among them. We will use a Hierarchical Clustering for this use case. However, this real use case can also be solved using other clustering techniques as K-Means or Mixture of Gaussians.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For this practice, we will use a customer base of a e-commerce. In particular, the dataset contains the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CustomerID`: Identication of the customer\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Genre`: Takes values of male or female\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Age`: corresponding to the customerID\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Annual_income`: customers' annual revenues (in K€)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Spending_score`: evaluation (from 1 to 100) done by the shop to its customers based the purchase frequency and other conditions\n"

Pretty straightforward, right?\n",
